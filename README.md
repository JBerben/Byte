# = Byte =
A classic RPG dungeon crawler designed for the Casio fx-G9750II.

## = About =
 In my last 3 years of highschool, I was required to purchase a Casio graphics calculator for the Calculus and Physics subjects I would
 be taking. It didn't take long until I found that they were programmable, and due to the lack of doccumentation on the internet, me
 and 2 of my other friends started the doccumentation of every function within the Casio BASIC API. In my last year of highschool,
 sitting in class and not paying any attention towards anything other than our calculators became the norm, and after making a series
 of shitty half assed games, I decided to make an indepth dungeon crawler called "Byte".
 
## = Features =
 The objective of Byte is to climb 256 dungeon floors whilst fighting monsters and bosses and collecting rare items. Some of my proudest 
 features include:
 
 - Randomly generated floors using my own noise algorithm
 - Monster individuality and typing
 - Saving and calling of data from the video RAM

## = Note =
 I encourage anyone who wants to learn Casio BASIC (for whatever strange reason), to look through my code and the data files to try and 
 make sense of some of the functions as it might be a good place to start.
 
### Casio BASIC is possibly the worst programming language I have ever had the pleasure of learning. I don't regret any of it though as it teaches a lot of the fundamental programming concepts such as optimisation and efficiency very thouroughly.
