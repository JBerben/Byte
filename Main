/* CONVENTIONS AND INFORMATION
/ Due to there being no decent decompiler for Casio BASIC, I will have to write
/ the code for the program by hand whilst looking at the code on my calculator.
/ The "arrow" key that is used to assign values to variables will be labeled
/ as "->". Any function such as "ClrText" or statements such as "if", "then",
/ "while" etc will all be in capital letters for ease of recognition.
